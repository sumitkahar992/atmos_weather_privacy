        <h1>Privacy Policy for Atmos Weather</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Effective Date: November 3, 2025</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>Important Notice:</strong> Atmos Weather is committed to protecting your privacy. We do not collect, store, or share any personal information. If you grant location permission, your location is only used temporarily to fetch weather data and is never stored or tracked.
        </div>

        <h2>1. Overview</h2>
        <p>
            <span class="app-name">Atmos Weather</span> ("we," "our," or "the App") is a weather application that provides current weather information and forecasts. This Privacy Policy describes how the App handles information when you use our services.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Information Collection and Use</h2>
        <p><strong>Location Information (Optional):</strong></p>
        <p>
            If you choose to enable location permission, Atmos Weather will access your device's GPS to determine your current location and provide weather information for your area. This location data is:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Only used to fetch weather data from WeatherAPI.com</li>
            <li>Not stored on our servers (we don't have any servers)</li>
            <li>Not logged, tracked, or saved anywhere</li>
            <li>Not shared with any third parties except WeatherAPI.com (only to retrieve weather data)</li>
            <li>Completely optional - you can use the app without granting location permission by manually searching for locations</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Information We Do NOT Collect:</strong></p>
        <p>Atmos Weather does not collect, transmit, or store any of the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Personal information (name, email, phone number, etc.)</li>
            <li>User account information (no registration or login required)</li>
            <li>Location history or location tracking</li>
            <li>Search history (search queries are sent to Mapbox but not stored by us)</li>
            <li>Device identifiers or advertising IDs</li>
            <li>Usage statistics or analytics data</li>
            <li>Crash reports or diagnostic data</li>
            <li>Any other personally identifiable information</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. How the App Works</h2>
        <p>
            <span class="app-name">Atmos Weather</span> provides weather information in the following ways:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Current Location Weather:</strong> If you grant location permission, the app uses your device's GPS to determine your current location coordinates and displays weather data for that area. The location coordinates are only used to fetch weather information and are not stored, logged, or transmitted anywhere except to WeatherAPI.com for retrieving weather data.</li>
            <li><strong>Manual Location Search:</strong> You can search for any city or location by name without enabling location permission. When you type a location name, your search query is sent to Mapbox Search Box API to provide location suggestions and retrieve coordinates (latitude/longitude). These coordinates are then used to fetch weather data from WeatherAPI.com.</li>
            <li><strong>Weather Data:</strong> Weather information is retrieved from WeatherAPI.com. Only the location coordinates (latitude/longitude) are sent to their servers to fetch weather data. No personal information is transmitted.</li>
            <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> All your preferences, saved locations, and backup data are stored locally on your device only. This data never leaves your device.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
            Atmos Weather uses the following third-party services to provide functionality:
        </p>

        <p>

        <p><strong>4.2 Mapbox Search Box API</strong></p>
