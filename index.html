        <h1>Privacy Policy for Atmos Weather</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Effective Date: November 3, 2025</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>Important Notice:</strong> Atmos Weather is committed to protecting your privacy. We do not collect, store, or share any personal information. If you grant location permission, your location is only used temporarily to fetch weather data and is never stored or tracked.
        </div>

        <h2>1. Overview</h2>
        <p>
            <span class="app-name">Atmos Weather</span> ("we," "our," or "the App") is a weather application that provides current weather information and forecasts. This Privacy Policy describes how the App handles information when you use our services.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Information Collection and Use</h2>
        <p><strong>Location Information (Optional):</strong></p>
        <p>
            If you choose to enable location permission, Atmos Weather will access your device's GPS to determine your current location and provide weather information for your area. This location data is:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Only used to fetch weather data from WeatherAPI.com</li>
            <li>Not stored on our servers (we don't have any servers)</li>
            <li>Not logged, tracked, or saved anywhere</li>
            <li>Not shared with any third parties except WeatherAPI.com (only to retrieve weather data)</li>
            <li>Completely optional - you can use the app without granting location permission by manually searching for locations</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Information We Do NOT Collect:</strong></p>
        <p>Atmos Weather does not collect, transmit, or store any of the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Personal information (name, email, phone number, etc.)</li>
            <li>User account information (no registration or login required)</li>
            <li>Location history or location tracking</li>
            <li>Search history (search queries are sent to Mapbox but not stored by us)</li>
            <li>Device identifiers or advertising IDs</li>
            <li>Usage statistics or analytics data</li>
            <li>Crash reports or diagnostic data</li>
            <li>Any other personally identifiable information</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. How the App Works</h2>
        <p>
            <span class="app-name">Atmos Weather</span> provides weather information in the following ways:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Current Location Weather:</strong> If you grant location permission, the app uses your device's GPS to determine your current location coordinates and displays weather data for that area. The location coordinates are only used to fetch weather information and are not stored, logged, or transmitted anywhere except to WeatherAPI.com for retrieving weather data.</li>
            <li><strong>Manual Location Search:</strong> You can search for any city or location by name without enabling location permission. When you type a location name, your search query is sent to Mapbox Search Box API to provide location suggestions and retrieve coordinates (latitude/longitude). These coordinates are then used to fetch weather data from WeatherAPI.com.</li>
            <li><strong>Weather Data:</strong> Weather information is retrieved from WeatherAPI.com. Only the location coordinates (latitude/longitude) are sent to their servers to fetch weather data. No personal information is transmitted.</li>
            <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> All your preferences, saved locations, and backup data are stored locally on your device only. This data never leaves your device.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
            Atmos Weather uses the following third-party services to provide functionality:
        </p>
        
        <p><strong>4.1 WeatherAPI.com</strong></p>
        <p>
            We use WeatherAPI.com to provide weather information. When you search for a location or use your current location, the location name or coordinates (latitude/longitude) are transmitted to WeatherAPI.com to retrieve current weather data and forecasts. This transmission constitutes data sharing as defined by app store policies, even though we do not store this information.
        </p>
        <p>
            WeatherAPI.com may collect technical information such as IP addresses and location coordinates for their service operation. Review their privacy policy:
            <a href="https://www.weatherapi.com/privacy.aspx" target="_blank">WeatherAPI.com Privacy Policy</a>
        </p>
        
        <p><strong>4.2 Mapbox Search Box API</strong></p>
        <p>
            We use Mapbox Search Box API to provide location search functionality. When you search for a city or location by name, your search query is transmitted to Mapbox to retrieve location suggestions and coordinates (latitude/longitude). Mapbox receives these search queries in real-time to provide autocomplete suggestions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mapbox may collect technical information such as IP addresses and search queries for their service operation. This information may be logged by Mapbox according to their policies. Review their privacy policy:
            <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/legal/privacy" target="_blank">Mapbox Privacy Policy</a>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <strong>Important:</strong> We do not have control over and are not responsible for the privacy practices of these third-party services. These services operate independently and have their own privacy policies and terms of service.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Data Storage</h2>
        <p>
            All data within Atmos Weather is stored locally on your device, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Saved locations and search history</li>
            <li>App preferences and settings</li>
            <li>Backup files (if created by you)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This data remains on your device and is never uploaded to any server or cloud service. You have full control over this data and can delete it at any time by clearing the app's data or uninstalling the app.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Backup and Restore</h2>
        <p>
            Atmos Weather allows you to create backup files of your saved locations and preferences. These backups are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Stored locally on your device by default</li>
            <li>Not transmitted to any external server by the app</li>
            <li>Under your complete control</li>
            <li>Can be deleted by you at any time</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>Important:</strong> Exported backup files may be saved to any location you choose on your device or uploaded to cloud storage services (such as Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.) if you choose to do so. You are responsible for securing and deleting these exported backup files. If you share or upload backup files to cloud services, those services' privacy policies will apply to that data.
        </p>

        <h2>7. No Advertisements</h2>
        <p>
            Atmos Weather does not display any advertisements and does not use any advertising networks or trackers. There are no third-party advertising SDKs integrated into the app.
        </p>

        <h2>8. No Analytics or Tracking</h2>
        <p>
            We do not use any analytics services, tracking tools, or crash reporting systems. The app does not collect any usage statistics or behavioral data.
        </p>

        <h2>9. Permissions</h2>
        <p>
            Atmos Weather may request the following permissions:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Location Permission (Optional):</strong> If you choose to grant location permission, the app will access your device's GPS to determine your current location and display weather for that area. You can deny this permission and still use the app by manually searching for locations. Location data is only used to fetch weather information and is not stored or tracked.</li>
            <li><strong>Internet Access:</strong> Required to fetch weather data from WeatherAPI.com</li>
            <li><strong>Storage Access:</strong> Required to save and restore backup files locally on your device</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>Important:</strong> Location permission is completely optional. If denied, you can still use all app features by searching for locations manually.
        </p>

        <h2>10. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>
            Atmos Weather is not directed to children under the age of 13 (or the applicable digital consent age in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect any information from anyone, including children. While the app does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data, we advise parents and guardians to monitor their children's use of the app.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has used the app and you have concerns, please contact us at <a href="mailto:sumitkahar073@gmail.com">sumitkahar073@gmail.com</a>. Although we do not collect any data, we will be happy to address any questions or concerns you may have.
        </p>

        <h2>11. Data Security</h2>
        <p>
            Since Atmos Weather does not collect or transmit any personal information, there is no personal data at risk. All data stored by the app remains locally on your device and is protected by your device's security features.
        </p>

        <h2>12. Your Rights and Control</h2>
        <p>
            You have complete control over any data stored by Atmos Weather:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>All data is stored locally on your device</li>
            <li>You can delete saved locations at any time within the app</li>
            <li>You can clear all app data through your device settings</li>
            <li>Uninstalling the app removes all data stored within the app</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>Note:</strong> Uninstalling the app will delete all locally stored data within the app, but it will not automatically delete any backup files you have exported and saved to other locations on your device or cloud storage services. You are responsible for deleting those exported backup files separately if desired.
        </p>

        <h2>13. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
            We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected by updating the "Effective Date" at the top of this policy.

        </p>

        <h2>14. International Users</h2>
        <p>

        </p>

        <h2>15. Legal Compliance</h2>
        <p>
            Atmos Weather aims to follow applicable data protection laws and privacy regulations, including GDPR, CCPA, and other regional requirements. Because we do not collect or store personal information, most data protection obligations do not apply to our app. However, we remain committed to transparency and user privacy in our operations.
